* [**Lecture notes on statistical physics of neural networks**](/assets/notes/SPNN.pdf) 

  Based on a set of lectures done at the "School of the Italian Society of Statistical Physics", IMT, Lucca, 2023. They can be also found on ArXiv at the following [*link*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.09240).

* [**Lecture notes on relativistic quantum mechanics**](/assets/notes/MQR.pdf) (in Italian)
    
    Klein–Gordon and Dirac fields; electromagnetic field, gauge invariance and quantization; perturbative QED with basic scattering processes; and Weyl/Dirac neutrino theory. Taken during M. Testa’s course in the Master in Theoretical Physics at Sapienza University of Rome. 

* [**Lecture notes on Quantum Field Theory**](/assets/notes/FieldTheory.pdf) (in Italian)
  
  They introduce relativistic QFT (locality, Lorentz structure, asymptotic states/S-matrix), develop the path-integral and generating-functional formalism with renormalization (incl. Callan–Symanzik), and conclude with fermions/Grassmann calculus and non-Abelian gauge theories with gauge fixing (Faddeev–Popov). Taken during M. Testa’s course in the Master in Theoretical Physics at Sapienza University of Rome. 


* [**Lecture notes on Statistical Field Theory**](/assets/notes/SFT.pdf)

  Lecture notes on statistical field theory and phase transitions. Landau–Ginzburg $\varphi^4$ theory; perturbation theory, Feynman diagrams and the renormalization group. transfer-matrix methods; and spontaneous symmetry breaking in $O(N)$ models with Goldstone modes.
  Taken during G. Parisi’s course in the Master in Theoretical Physics at Sapienza University of Rome. Some chapters are incomplete.
