## Exams

Students will be evaluated on the basis of a written exam. The written exam will be divided into
two partial exams held during the semester or one final general exam.
Each type of exam will contribute to the final grade as follows:
* General exam: 32 points
* Each partial exam: 16 points
A grade of 30 cum laude corresponds to 31 or 32 points.
To pass the exam, students must earn a grade of at least 18.
The written exams consists in solving some exercises to be worked out on paper. The purpose
of the exercises will be to test knowledge of fundamental physical laws and the ability to model
and solve problems. An aptitude for problem solving along with a rigorous use of advanced
mathematical tools is the main skill the exams are intended to assess. The written exam is
not open-book.
