## Exam

20% of the final grade given by individual assignments. The students will be required to derive and implement in a specific setting the generic algorithms discussed during the course.

80% of the final grade given by oral exam. Understanding of all the topics covered in the course will be evaluated. Besides verbally answering questions, students will be asked to reproduce part of calculations seen during the course using pen and paper or a whiteboard.
