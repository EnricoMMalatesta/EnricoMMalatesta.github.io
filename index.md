I am an Assistant Professor at the [Computing Sciences Department](https://cs.unibocconi.eu/) at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/it) in Milan.

My research lies at the interface of theoretical physics and computer science. 
I am particularly interested in the statistical mechanics of disordered systems and their interdisciplinary applications, including constrained optimization problems, machine learning, and high-dimensional statistics.

For more information see my [publications](/pages/publications/) and [CV](/pages/cv/).



<!-- I am in particular interested in the statistical mechanics of disordered systems and their interdisciplinary applications, ranging from constrained optimization problems, to machine learning and high dimensional statistics. 
, in particular statistical physics and machine learning.. Broadly speaking, I am interested in analytically characterizing the typical landscape of optimization, inference and machine learning problems in high-dimensions, using physics-inspired techniques borrowed from the statistical mechanics of disordered system, as long as advanced methods in probability and random matrix theory. -->

<!-- I am also interested in exploiting this knowledge to explain the dynamics of simple algorithms and to design new algorithmic paradigms. -->
